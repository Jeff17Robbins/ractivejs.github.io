title: Ractive.getNodeInfo()
---
Sometimes it is useful to know which Ractive instance a DOM node is attached to and the details of where it exists in the view. `Ractive.getNodeInfo()` is a static method that exposes this information based on Ractive's internal tracking mechanisms.

This is particularly useful for {{{createLink 'decorators'}}}.

> ### Ractive.getNodeInfo( node )
> Returns an object with a reference to the Ractive instance, the keypath in the view, and any indices that are available from the view.
> `{ ractive: instance, keypath: keypath, index: indices }`

> > #### **node** *`DOMNode`*
> > The DOM node for which you wish to retrieve the Ractive instance or view details.
