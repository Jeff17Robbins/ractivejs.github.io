title: ractive.observe()
---
Observes the data at a particular {{{createLink 'keypaths' 'keypath'}}}. Unless specified otherwise, the callback will be fired immediately, with `undefined` as `oldValue`. Thereafter it will be called whenever the *observed keypath* changes.

Note that you can observe keypath *patterns*...

```js
ractive.observe( 'items.*.status', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath ) {
	var index = /items.(\d+).status/.exec( keypath )[1];
	alert( 'item ' + index + ' status changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue );
});
```

...or multiple space-separated keypaths simultaneously:

```js
ractive.observe( 'foo bar baz', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath ) {
	alert( keypath + ' changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue );
});
```

See {{{createLink 'Observers'}}} for more detail.


> ### ractive.observe( keypath, callback[, options ])
> Returns an object with a `cancel` method, for cancelling the observer

> > #### **keypath** *`String`*
> > The [keypath](keypaths) to observe, or a group of space-separated keypaths. Any of the keys can be a `*` character, which is treated as a wildcard.
> > #### **callback** *`Function`*
> > The function that will be called, with `newValue`, `oldValue` and `keypath` as arguments (see {{{createLink 'Observers'}}} for more nuance regarding these arguments), whenever the observed keypath changes value. By default the function will be called with `ractive` as `this`
> > #### options *`Object`*
> > > #### init *`Boolean`*
> > > Defaults to `true`. Whether or not to initialise the observer, i.e. call the function with the current value of `keypath` as the first argument and `undefined` as the second
> > > #### defer *`Boolean`*
> > > Defaults to `false`, in which case observers will fire before any DOM changes take place. If `true`, the observer will fire once the DOM has been updated.
> > > #### context
> > > Defaults to `ractive`. The context the observer is called in (i.e. the value of `this`)
> > > #### debug *`Boolean`*
> > > Defaults to `false` - exceptions that are thrown within observers are handled. This is useful when observing uninitialised keypaths when you don't want to litter your code with `if (foo !== undefined) { /*...*/ }`, but you may prefer to handle errors yourself, in which case use `true`.


> ### ractive.observe( map[, options ])
> Returns an object with a `cancel` method, for cancelling all observers

> > #### **map** *`Object`*
> > A map of `keypath: observer` pairs
> > #### options *`Object`*
> > As above.
