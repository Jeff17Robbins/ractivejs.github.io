title: ractive.detachChild()
---

Detaches a child from an instance when it was previously attached with {{{createLink 'ractive.attachChild()'}}}.

When a child instance that was attached targeting an anchor is detached, its instance is spliced out of the `@this.children.byName.anchorName` array so that subsequent children move forward to fill the void.

> ### ractive.link( child )
> Returns a `Promise` (see {{{createLink 'Promises'}}}) that resolves with the child instance when any transitions are complete.

> > ### **child** *`Ractive instance`*
> > The instance to detach.
