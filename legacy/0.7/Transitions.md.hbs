Transitions allow you to control how elements are first rendered and how they are removed from the DOM. They are added with `intro` and `outro` directives, which look like attributes within a template (but are not rendered to the DOM as attributes):

```html
<div intro='fade'>This element will fade in gradually when it renders</div>
```

This works because (or rather, if) Ractive is able to find a `fade` function on either {{{createLink 'ractive-transitions-instance' 'ractive.transitions'}}} (i.e. instance-specific transitions) or {{{createLink 'ractive-transitions-global' 'Ractive.transitions'}}} (i.e. globally-available transitions).

To start using transitions, download them from the {{{createLink 'Plugins'}}} page.
