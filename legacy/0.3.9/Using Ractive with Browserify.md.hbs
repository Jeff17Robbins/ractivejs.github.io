[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is a way of using [node-style](http://nodejs.org/) requires in the browser, bundling your scripts into a single file for efficient deployment.

You can use Ractive.js alongside Browserify using [Ractify](https://npmjs.org/package/ractify) by [marcello3d](https://github.com/marcello3d) (thanks!). Visit the [Ractify repository](https://github.com/marcello3d/node-ractify) for downloads and documentation.
