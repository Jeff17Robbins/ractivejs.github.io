*See also: {{{createLink 'proxy events'}}}*

As an alternative to {{{createLink 'proxy events'}}}, you can call any method of your Ractive instance, in response to an {{{createLink 'event directives' 'event directive'}}}, right from your template:

```html
<p>foo is \{{foo}}</p>
<button on-click='toggle("foo")'>toggle foo</button>
```

In this case, because {{{createLink 'ractive.toggle()'}}} is a built-in method, clicking the button will toggle the value of `foo` between `true` and `false` ([demo](http://jsfiddle.net/rich_harris/xxg93vw8/)).

This also works with custom methods:

```js
var ractive = new Ractive({
  el: 'body',
  template: '<button on-click="klaxon()">sound the klaxon</button>',
  audio: new Audio( 'klaxon.mp3' ),
  klaxon: function () {
    this.audio.play();
  }
});
```

You can pass as many arguments to the method as you like, including data references:

```html
\{{#each items :i}}
  <button on-click='select(this,i)'>select this item</button>
\{{/each}}
```

Notice that mustaches are __not__ used with data reference in method calls, i.e. `\{{i}}` and will cause errors if they are. String literals need to be in quotes:

```html
<button on-click='set( "foo", true)'>make foo true</button>
```

You can also pass the `event` object, or properties thereof (`event.original` is the original DOM event) ([demo](http://jsfiddle.net/rich_harris/9ecvjjtm/)):

```html
<div
  on-mousemove='set({
    x: event.original.clientX,
    y: event.original.clientY
  })'
  on-mouseleave='set({
    x: "unknown",
    y: "unknown"
  })'
>
  <p>current mouse position: \{{x}} x \{{y}}</p>
</div>
```

The `event` object is also available within body of the method call function as `this.event`. Note that methods on your Ractive instance that may handle your events are effectively part of your public API, and `this.event` will only be available during invocations triggered by an event.

### Cancelling events

As with proxy events, you can cancel a DOM event by returning `false` from your event handler. Ractive will then call `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` on the original DOM event. You can also call any methods on the original event by having it passed to your handler or accessing it using `this.event.original`.
