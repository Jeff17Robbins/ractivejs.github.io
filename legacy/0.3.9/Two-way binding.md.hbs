title: Two-way binding
---
By default, a Ractive instance will update its internal model based on user input, if you have `<input>`, `<textarea>` or `<select>` elements.

If that's unhelpful for your app, you can disable it by passing `twoway: false` as an {{{createLink 'initialisation-options' 'initialisation option'}}}.


## `<input>` elements

Two-way binding works with `<input>` elements of any type, including the new HTML5 types such as `color` or `email`. In most cases, you just add a mustache as the `value` attribute - this must be a single, standard *interpolator* mustache, like this:

```html
<input placeholder='Type your name' value='\{{user.name}}'>
```

In the example above, any changes the user makes to the input will be reflected in the `user.name` property.

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes are used to flag a property as `true` or `false`. Rather than binding the `value` attribute, we bind the `checked` attribute:

```html
<label>
	<input type='checkbox' checked='\{{on}}'>
	The lights are \{{ on ? 'on' : 'off' }}
</label>
```

(True HTML nerds will recognise that *boolean attributes* such as checked don't have a value, as such - they either exist on an element or they don't. This makes life unnecessarily difficult; Ractive treats dynamic (i.e., controlled by a mustache) boolean attributes as present if the mustache is `true`, absent if `false`.)

### Radios

Radio buttons can be controlled in the same way as checkboxes. However the chances are, if you're using radio buttons, you have a set of mutually exclusive options to choose between. In this case, if you set the `name` attribute on a radio input to e.g. `\{{someValue}}`, `someValue` will reflect the `value` of the currently checked option:

```html
<label><input type='radio' name='\{{color}}' value='red' checked> Red</label>
<label><input type='radio' name='\{{color}}' value='green'> Green</label>
<label><input type='radio' name='\{{color}}' value='blue'> Blue</label>

<p>The currently selected color is <span style='color: \{{color}};'>\{{color}}</span></p>
```

In the example above, the value of `color` will initially be `'red'` (because that input is checked in the template), and will update as and when the user selects another option.


## `<textarea>` elements

Textareas work exactly the same as standard text inputs - slap a dynamic `value` attribute on them, and you're done:

```html
<textarea value='\{{content}}'></textarea>
```


## `<select>` elements

Drop-down select menus are good when you have many options to choose from. They're straightforward to use in Ractive:

```html
<select value='\{{selectedCountry}}'>
	<option selected disabled>Select a country</option>
	\{{#countries}}
		<option value='\{{id}}'>\{{name}}</option>
	\{{/countries}}
</select>
```

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
	el: myContainer,
	template: myTemplate,
	data: {
		countries: [
			{ id: 'AFG', name: 'Afghanistan' },
			{ id: 'ALB', name: 'Albania' },
			{ id: 'DZA', name: 'Algeria' },
			{ id: 'ASM', name: 'American Samoa' }
			// and so on...
		]
	}
});
```

In the example above, no country will initially be selected. If the user were to select Afghanistan from the list, the value of `selectedCountry` would change to `'AFG'`.


## Ambiguous references

A mustache used in a two-way binding context must have an *unambiguous reference*. Consider the following:

```html
\{{#foo}}
	<input value='\{{bar}}'>
\{{/foo}}
```

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
	el: myContainer,
	template: myTemplate,
	data: { foo: {} }
});
```

Ractive must decide, straight away, what {{{createLink 'keypaths' 'keypath'}}} to bind the input's `value` attribute to. It will first see if it can {{{createLink 'references' 'resolve the reference'}}} (`'bar'`) given the current context stack (which includes a single context - `'foo'`). It can't, so it is forced to make an assumption - that the `'bar'` reference should resolve to the `'bar'` keypath.

But this might not be what you want - maybe you *did* want it to resolve to `'foo.bar'`.

You have two options - either use a {{{createLink 'mustaches' 'restricted reference' 'restricted-references'}}}, i.e. `<input value='\{{.bar}}'>`, or ensure that `foo` has a `bar` property (even if the initial value is `undefined`).

## Lazy updates

Under the hood, Ractive always binds to the `change` event (and the `click` event in IE, in the case of checkboxes, due to an IE bug). By default, it will also bind to the `input` event, which means the model is updated instantly when the user enters data (the `change` event fires when a change is ['committed by the user'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/change)). In some situations, that's not what you want - if you want to only bind to `change`, pass in `lazy: true` as an {{{createLink 'initialisation-options' 'initialisation option'}}}.

## Observing changes

To use user input elsewhere in your app, you'll need to observe it using {{{createLink 'active.observe()'}}}:

```html
<input placeholder='Type your name' value='\{{user.name}}'>
```

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
	el: myContainer,
	template: myTemplate
});

ractive.observe( 'user.name', function ( newValue ) {
	app.user.name = newValue;
	triggerSomeBehaviour();
});
```
