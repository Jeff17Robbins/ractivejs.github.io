title: Events
---
Like many libraries, Ractive implements the [publish/subscribe](http://addyosmani.com/blog/understanding-the-publishsubscribe-pattern-for-greater-javascript-scalability/) mechanism to allow you to trigger behaviour at certain points.

There are three types of events - standard events, proxy events, and custom events. They all use the same interface - {{{createLink 'ractive.on()'}}}:

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
  el: myContainer,
  template: myTemplate
});

ractive.on( 'teardown', function () {
  alert( 'Bye!' );
});
```

In all cases, event handlers will be called with `ractive` as `this`.

## Standard events

Standard events are those emitted by all Ractive instances:

###change

Fired whenever any data changes inside of a Ractive instance. To observe only on specific keypaths see {{{createLink 'Observers'}}}.

### teardown

Fired whenever {{{createLink 'ractive.teardown()'}}} is called. No arguments.


## Proxy events

Proxy events are a convenient way of handling user interaction. Instead of doing `someElement.addEventListener( eventName, handler )` or `$( someSelector ).on( eventName, handler )`, you can write the name of a *proxy event* right into your template:

```html
<button on-click='activate'>Activate!</button>
<button on-click='deactivate'>Deactivate!</button>
```

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
  el: myContainer,
  template: myTemplate
});

ractive.on({
  activate: function ( event ) {
    // do something
  },
  deactivate: function ( event ) {
    // do something
  }
});
```

This way we don't have to bother traversing the DOM or storing references to elements and handlers. We also don't need to worry about removing event handlers when we detach chunks of the DOM - Ractive takes care of it.

Proxy event handlers receive an `event` argument. This isn't the same as the `event` argument you'd receive in a traditional handler (i.e. bound with `node.addEventListener` or `$(node).on()` etc), but an object with five properties:

* `node` - the relevant element
* `original` - the underlying DOM event (useful for `event.original.preventDefault()` etc)
* `keypath` - the keypath of the current context
* `context` - the value of `ractive.get(event.keypath)`
* `index` - a map of index references

*TODO - explain what the hell the last three of those things meant... In the meantime folks, do a `console.log( event )` inside your handlers and all will be revealed!*

Because of the way proxy events work, they more or less eliminate the need for event delegation.

Any standard DOM event that an element supports can be used (e.g. `on-mouseover='highlight'`, `on-touchstart='dragstart'`, `on-blur='submit'`, `on-error='loadFallbackImage'`, and so on), as can non-standard {{{createLink 'event plugins'}}} such as `on-tap`.

*TODO - chained proxy events, additional arguments in custom event definitions*

## Reserved Event Names

In order for Ractive to provide a level of notification that is desirable there are 4 reserved event names.
You may listen for these names as you would with normal events however these events will not contain the typical structure of an event that you'd exepect.

> ### change
> the change event is fired when any data changes from the template and the callback is called with a single argument that is the reference to the part of the data object that was updated.

> ### update
> the update event is fired when any data promatically changes and the callback is called with a single argument that is the new data object that was updated.

> ### reset
> the reset event is fired when the Ractive instance is reset from the `reset` function, the callback is called with an empty object

> ### teardown
> the teardown event is fired when the Ractive instance is destroyed from the `teardown` function, the callback is called with no arguments

## Custom events

You can easily create events of your own with {{{createLink 'ractive.fire()'}}}. This is most useful in the context of subclasses created with {{{createLink 'Ractive.extend()'}}}.

In this example, we respond to the user clicking on an item by firing a `selected` event with the item data as the first (and only) argument:

```html
<div class='catalogue'>
  \{{#items:i}}
    <div on-tap='select' data-index='\{{i}}'>
      \{{>content}}
    </div>
  \{{/items}}
</div>
```

```js
var Catalogue = Ractive.extend({
  template: catalogueTemplate,
  partials: { content: contentPartial }, // pretend we made one
  init: function ( options ) {
    var self = this, items = options.items;

    this.on( 'select', function ( event ) {
      var index = event.node.getAttribute( 'data-index' );
      self.fire( 'selected', items[ index ] );
    });
  }
});
```
