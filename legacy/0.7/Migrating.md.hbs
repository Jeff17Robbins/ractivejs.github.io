title: 'Migrating to 0.7.x'
---

These migration notes are cribbed from the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md). While we strive to minimise breaking changes, and to highlight the ones we do introduce, if you discover an undocumented breaking change please edit this page.

## Migrating from 0.6.x

### What's new

Components can now access their parents and containers using an official API.

Binding directives may be set on elements that support two-way binding. These directives override the settings on the Ractive instance for `twoway` and `lazy`.

Single-fire versions of `ractive.on` and `ractive.observe` are now available as `ractive.once` and `ractive.observeOnce`.

Inline partials can now be defined within a new section `\{{#partial partial-name}}...\{{/partial}}`. The old comment syntax is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Inline partials are now scoped to their nearest element. If a partial reference sits in the template below an element with a matching inline partial, the inline partial will be used in the reference. This can be used as a sort of partial inheritance. If an inline partial is defined directly within a component tag or the root of the template, it will be added to the Ractive instance.

Components may now yield to multiple inline partials by supplying the partial name with yield e.g. `\{{yield some-name}}`. Yielding without a name will still result in non-partial content being yielded. Only inline partials may be yielded. Any partials, including inline and inherited, may still be referenced within a component using a plain partial section e.g. `\{{>partial}}`.

Partials can now be reset without resorting to manually un/re-rendering them using a wrapping conditional section. This can be done with the new `resetPartial` {{{ createLink 'Ractive.resetPartial()' 'method' }}} on Ractive instances.

`this.event` is now available to method-call event handlers.

Regular expression literals can now be used in template expressions.

You can now escape mustaches with a '\' if you'd like them to appear in the template.

`ractive.toggle` now works with patterns.

The debug setting is no longer set per-instance. It has been replaced with `Ractive.DEBUG`, which defaults to true. You can set it automatically based on whether or not the your code has been minified with:
```js
Ractive.DEBUG = /unminified/.test(function(){/*unminified*/});
```

### Breaking changes and deprecation

* `twoway` and `lazy` are now reserved attribute names to be used as binding directives.
* Inline partials now belong to their nearest element.
* The comment syntax for inline partials is now deprecated.
* `elseif` is now a reserved identifier.
* `ractive.data` is no longer available. Use `ractive.get()` to get a shallow copy of the data with any component mappings.
* Child data always overrides parent data, whether it is a POJO or not.
* `ractive.debug` has been replaced with the global `Ractive.DEBUG` flag.

## Migrating from 0.5.x

### Lifecycle events

Ractive instances now emit *lifecycle events*. If you use `Ractive.extend(...)` with `init()`, `beforeInit()` or `complete()`, you will need to replace them - they will continue to work, but will be removed in a future version.

`init()` can be replaced with one of the following methods, or you may need to split your code into both methods. Use `onrender()` for code that needs access to the rendered DOM, but is safe being called more than once if you unrender and rerender your ractive instance. Use `oninit()` for code that should run only once or needs to be run regardless of whether the ractive instance is rendered into the DOM.

The `init()` method also no longer recieves an `options` parameter as the ractive instance now inherits _all_ options passed to the constructor. You can still access the options directly using the `onconstruct()` method.

`beforeInit()` and `complete()` can be replaced directly with `onconstruct()` and `oncomplete()` respectively.

See the {{{createLink 'lifecycle events'}}} page for more detail.

### Other Breaking changes

* `new Ractive()` now inherits all options as methods/properties including event hooks. If you have been passing data through custom initialisation options be aware that they will appended to your ractive instance.
* Using other elements besides `<script>` for templates is an now an error. Migrate any templates in non-script elements and include a non-javascript type so the browser does not try to interpret your template:

	```js
		<script id='template' type='text/ractive'>
			Your template goes here
		</script>
	```

* New reserved events cannot be used for proxy event names, i.e. `<p on-click='init'></p>`. These include 'change', 'config', 'construct', 'init', 'render', 'reset', 'teardown', 'unrender', and 'update'. You will need to rename your events.
* Setting uninitialised data on a component will no longer cause it to leak out into the parent scope
* 'Smart updates', via `ractive.merge()` and `ractive.shift()` etc, work across component boundaries. In most cases this is the expected behavior.
* The CSS length interpolator has been removed.


## Migrating from 0.4.x

### Breaking changes

* Errors in observers and evaluators are no longer caught
* Nodes are detached as soon as any outro transitions are complete (if any), rather than when *all* transitions are complete
* (Outdated if you are moving to `0.6.x` or above) The options argument of `init: function(options)` is now strictly what was passed into the constructor, use `this.option` to access configured value.
* `data` with properties on prototype are no longer cloned when accessed. `data` from "baseClass" is no longer deconstructed and copied.
* Options specified on component constructors will not be picked up as defaults. `debug` now on `defaults`, not constructor
* Select bindings follow general browser rules for choosing options. Disabled options have no value.
* Input values are not coerced to numbers, unless input type is `number` or `range`
* `\{{this.foo}}` in templates now means same thing as `\{{.foo}}`
* Rendering to an element already render by Ractive causes that element to be torn down (unless appending).
* Illegal javascript no longer allowed by parser in expressions and will throw
* Parsed template format changed to specify template spec version.
	* Proxy-event representation
	* Non-dynamic (bound) fragments of html are no longer stored as single string
	* See https://github.com/ractivejs/template-spec for current spec.
* Arrays being observed via `array.*` no longer send `item.length` event on mutation changes
* Reserved event names in templates ('change', 'config', 'construct', 'init', 'render', 'reset', 'teardown', 'unrender', 'update') will cause the parser to throw an error
* `\{{else}}` support in both handlebars-style blocks and regular mustache conditional blocks, but is now a restricted keyword that cannot be used as a regular reference
* Child components are created in data order
* Reference expressions resolve left to right and follow same logic as regular mustache references (bind to root, not context, if left-most part is unresolved).
* Improved attribute parsing and handling:
	* character escaping and whitespace handling in attribute directive arguments
	* boolean and empty string attributes
* Computed properties no longer create nested objects with keypath like names, i.e. `page.area: '${width} * ${height}'` creates a property accessible by `\{{page.area}}` but not `\{{#page}}\{{area}}\{{/page}}`
* The element into which the ractive instance was rendered is no longer available as `ractive.el`. See {{{createLink 'ractive.render()'}}} and {{{createLink 'ractive.insert()'}}} for more information on moving ractive instances in the DOM.
