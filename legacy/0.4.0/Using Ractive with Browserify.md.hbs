title: Using Ractive with Browserify
---
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is a way of using [node-style](http://nodejs.org/) requires in the browser, bundling your scripts into a single file for efficient deployment.

There are two Browserify transforms available that you can use for Ractive.js:

- [Ractivate](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ractivate), a transform that will pre-parse templates. Contributed by [jrajav](https://github.com/jrajav). [(Github repository)](https://github.com/jrajav/ractivate)
- [Ractify](https://npmjs.org/package/ractify), a transform that will pre-compile components. Contributed by [marcello3d](https://github.com/marcello3d). [(Github repository)](https://github.com/marcello3d/node-ractify)

A [starter project](https://github.com/alienscience/gulp-ractive-starter) is available for using Ractivate with [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) build system.
