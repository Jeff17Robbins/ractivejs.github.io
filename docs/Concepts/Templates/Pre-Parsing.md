Before Ractive can render a template, it has to *parse* it. Parsing consists of reading the HTML and constructing a tree-like structure that represents the structure of the HTML, but also [mustaches]() and their [references]() or [expressions](../Templates/Expressions.md), along with any other concepts that aren't represented by HTML such as [transitions]() and [event proxies]().
